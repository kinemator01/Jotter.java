# 📝 Jotter Application

Jotter is a simple text editor we built as part of our **first-year Java group project** at CPUT.  
It’s kind of like a lightweight Notepad but with extra features like text formatting, image insertion, and search.

## Features
- Create, open, save, and print text files
- Cut, copy, paste, delete, and select all
- Change font family, size, and style (Bold/Italic)
- Insert images directly into the text area 🖼️
- Search panel with keyword highlighting 🔎
- Word and character count in the status bar
- Multiple windows support (open new Jotter instances)

## My Contributions
This was a group project, but I worked specifically on:
- **Search Panel**: lets you search words in the document and highlights all matches
- **Insert Image Feature**: adds images into the text area
- **Designed our logo**: created the branding for Jotter’s icon

---

## Tech Stack
- **Language**: Java
- **GUI**: Swing
- **Other**: AWT for events, Java IO for file handling

Future Improvements

Better UI design (modern look with JavaFX maybe)

Dark mode 🌙

More export formats (PDF, DOCX)

Spell checker

Cloud sync so your notes are available everywhere ☁️ (we wanted to add this, but at the time we didn’t know much about databases)
